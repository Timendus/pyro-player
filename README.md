# Pyro Player

Pyro Player is a quick'n'dirty piece of software to control a simple pyromusical
this December ðŸŽ† ðŸ˜„

## Preparation

### Hardware / software (todo)

* Solder some transmitter hardware to some board (instructions todo)
* Flash something on a board (software todo)

### Content

* Create a `.srt` subtitle file for your music(video) with numbers
* Those numbers correspond to the queues on your firework igniter (DB04R)
* Get your music and your `.srt` file ready

### Fireworks

* Connect the right fireworks to the right queues on the igniter
* Put them in the right spots and all that, in range of the board's transmitter

## Execution

* Power up the board, wait for it to boot
* Connect to the board's wifi
* Open a webbrowser and load the website (the one from `./web-player`)
* Upload your `.srt` file (and your music file too, maybe?)
* Press play

The right queues should be lit at the right times, firing the fireworks in sync
with your music.
