# Pyro Player

Pyro Player is a quick'n'dirty piece of software to control a simple pyromusical
this December ðŸŽ† ðŸ˜„

## Concept

We use the DB04r firework firing system / receiver that gets its commands over
433Mhz. We send commands to it through a Raspberry Pi, that we then in turn
control through WebSockets over WiFi. Assuming that there is no WiFi present
where you wish to run your pyromusical, we set up the Raspberry Pi to act as an
access point. Because the sound card of the Pi is pretty crappy, we play the
music on the client device (your phone or laptop).

## Stuff that you need

* Raspberry Pi
* 433Mhz transmitter board like the FS1000A
* (A couple of) DB04r receiver(s)
* WiFi client device (your phone or laptop, for example)
* Nice set of (wired) speakers
* Fireworks!

## Preparation

### Hardware / software

Warning: These steps assume that you know what you're doing ðŸ˜‰

* Attach the transmitter to your Raspberry Pi ([as shown here](https://pypi.org/project/rpi-rf/#wiring-diagram-example). Don't know how? [See this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe5Bj_N4Crw))
* Install Raspbian on the Raspberry Pi
* Install Pyro Player and its dependencies by running in a terminal:

```bash
/home/pi $ sudo apt-get install git nodejs npm python3-pip
/home/pi $ pip3 install rpi-rf
/home/pi $ git clone git@github.com:Timendus/pyro-player.git
/home/pi $ cd pyro-player
/home/pi/pyro-player $ npm install
```

* Test that you can successfully run `npm start`. This should start a webserver on port 80
* Configure Pyro Player to start on boot:

```bash
/home/pi/pyro-player $ npm run install-service
```

* Configure your Pi as a WiFi access point. *Do this over a cabled connection as you will lose any previous WiFi connection!* You have been warned ðŸ˜œ

```bash
/home/pi/pyro-player $ npm run make-access-point
```

* Reboot the Raspberry Pi

After a minute or so you should see a WiFi access point `PyroPlayer` show up. The password is `PyroMusical`. The Pi is then at `192.168.4.1`.

### Content

* Most importantly: choose a nice song! ðŸ˜‰
* Using an editor of your choice, create a `.srt` subtitle file for your music(video) with commands instead of subtitles
* Those commands correspond to the queues on your firework receivers, available commands [listed here](https://github.com/Timendus/pyro-player/blob/master/shared/commands.js)
* Some things to consider when writing your commands:
  * It's safer to leave the first second of the `.srt` file empty, because the software currently can't compensate for the transmission delay there
  * A safe interval between commands is currently 300 milliseconds or more. (The transmitting software probably needs some time to claim and release the hardware pins)
  * You can test your files by doing a 'dry run' [here](https://timendus.github.io/pyro-player/web-player/)

### Fireworks

* Connect the right fireworks to the right queues on the igniter
* Put them in the right spots and all that, in range of the Pi's transmitter (the range was ~200 meters in our first test ðŸ˜®)

## Execution

* Power up the Raspberry Pi, wait for it to boot (tip: use a 2 ampere USB power bank)
* Connect your WiFi client device to a nice set of (wired) speakers. Don't use Bluetooth because it introduces a delay
* On your client device:
  * Connect to the WiFi access point "PyroPlayer", password "PyroMusical"
  * Open a web browser and navigate to `pyro.com` (or whatever, the pi should catch any http request that isn't in your cache. If all else fails, go to `http://192.168.4.1`)
  * You should see the Pyro Player interface
  * Upload your music file and your `.srt` file
  * Press play

The right queues should be lit at the right times, firing the fireworks in sync
with your music.

Magic ðŸŽ†

## Easter eggs of the DB04r

Our set is supposed to go up to 12 queues, corresponding with the 12 buttons on
the remote. However, it turns out we can program the receivers with higher
numbers too. Put the receiver in programming mode and send the first number of
the set of four that you want the receiver to respond to. So if you want it to
respond to 17, 18, 19 and 20, you have to send it 17. You can use the Pyro
Player for that, with a random music file and a `.srt` file that reads:

```srt
1
00:00:00,000 ---> 00:00:00,000
fire 17
```

Another Easter egg that we discovered is that some codes trigger "special
behaviour" in the receivers. For example, if you send the code 13, all the
numbers from 1 through 12 will fire at once. If you send the code 15, they will
all fire in sequence, one after the other. And this goes for the higher numbers
too, so sending the code 29 will trigger all of the queues 17 to 28 to fire at
once.

Because of this behaviour, there is no command `fire 13`, but instead there is
a command `fire 1 through 12 now`. See our [list of commands](https://github.com/Timendus/pyro-player/blob/master/shared/commands.js),
where we have tried to document the magic codes.
